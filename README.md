**Project Description:** This project leverages predictive data analytics to classify music genres based on audio features. I cleaned data and transformed it's variables to accomodate for modeling. Using Python and a combination of both categorical and quantitative models, I built a system that predicts the genre of a song by analyzing its inherent audio characteristics. The dataset includes a range of features such as tempo, danceability, acousticness, loudness, and more, which were processed and used to train various machine learning models.

I applied data science techniques to enhance model performance and employed a variety of algorithms, including decision trees, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors, to analyze relationships within the data.
